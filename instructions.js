/* MULTIPLICATION QUIZ KATA */

/* INSTRUCTIONS for PART 1 */

// 1. Print 2 Random Integers, X & Y, each between 3 and 9, as a soluble equation:  X * Y = ??
// 2. Receive manual input for solution, say "Correct!" if match, "Incorrect!" if not.
// 3. Embed equation in While loop that continues until entry matches solution, or = "stop".
// 4. Embed all code in a For loop and run it 10 times.

/* INSTRUCTIONS for PART 2: REFACTOR INTO FUNCTIONS */

// 5. Move code parts 1-3 into a function called multiPractice, and call multiPractice within the For loop.
// 6. Count how many not-right-first-answers and return that count from multiPractice.
// 7. At "stop" or loop end, report # answers wrong.  If no wrong answers, say "Charlie, you've won!"
// 8. Extra Credit: instead of 10 times, run loop to value of questions variable entered manually.
